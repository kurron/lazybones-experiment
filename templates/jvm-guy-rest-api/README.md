#Overview
The application provides a temporary store for binary assets.  The idea is that The Application will be used as a
'post office box' that coordinating applications can use to drop off and pick up assets.

#Launch Scripts
As a convenience, there are some scripts to launch The Application from the command line.  Typical usage is:
`bin/launch.sh`.  There is a launch script for each profile that the application supports.
